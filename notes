Scrapers needed:
  -> Scrape main page to collect name, location, url, and category
  -> Scrape secondary page specific to each hostel to collect ratings and defining characteristics

** Overall Flow (revised) **

1. Welcome user
2. Scrape main page to create objects containing category and associated hostels in category.
  -> Hostels within this object will contain name, location, and URL.
3. Display categories and ask user which category they would like to view hostels for.
4. Take user input and output a list of the hostels in selected category.
5. Ask user to select hostel they would like more info on.
6. Take user input and scrape the url for the selected hostel.
7. Using scraped data, output name, location, URL, rating, and top 3 qualities.
(!)8. Give user option to have the URL opened in their default browser (if possible).
9. Should give user option of restarting at any point.
