** Overall Basic Flow (revised) **

#1. Welcome user
#2. Scrape main page to create objects containing category and associated hostels in category.
  #-> Hostels within this object will contain name, location, and URL.
#3. Display categories and ask user which category they would like to view hostels for.
#4. Take user input and output a list of the hostels in selected category.
#5. Ask user to select hostel they would like more info on.
#6. Take user input and scrape the url for the selected hostel.
#7. Using scraped data, output name, location, URL, ratings, and top 3 qualities.
#8. Give user option to have the URL opened in their default browser (if possible).
#9. At this point, allow user to start from the beginning.
#10. Should give user option of exiting at any point.

** Possible Addition/Extension **

Description: Take input from user containing dates of stay and # of guests and return availability and pricing.

1. Request user input for arrival date, departure date, and # of guests
2. Use this input to open the hostel's webpage listing availabilities for these dates/# of guests.
3. Scrape the page to collect room type, description, availability, and price.
4. Add this info to an instance of the Room class which will also have the Hostel instance info.
5. Return the info to the user. Use price to provide total for # of nights selected.
6. Send them to the website if they want to proceed with booking.

Availability link below. Appears to follow a somewhat standard sequence regardless of date/guests.
url = "#{hostel.url}?dateFrom=#{user_start_date}&dateTo=#{user_end_date}&number_of_guests=#{user_guests}&origin=microsite"

main = url.css("form.form table.table.table-availability") # sections with all availabilities and prices
rooms = main.css("tr.room-tr.room-tr-last")
room_type = rooms.css("p.room-label span.room-title").text.strip
room_desc = rooms.css("div.text-dark-gray.text-small").text.strip
availability = rooms.css("div.badge.badge-small.badge-outline-blue.badge-availability.badge-room-image").text.strip
price = rooms.css("span.rate-type-price").text.strip

*** Left to Complete ***
