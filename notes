** Overall Basic Flow (revised) **

#1. Welcome user
#2. Scrape main page to create objects containing category and associated hostels in category.
  #-> Hostels within this object will contain name, location, and URL.
#3. Display categories and ask user which category they would like to view hostels for.
#4. Take user input and output a list of the hostels in selected category.
#5. Ask user to select hostel they would like more info on.
#6. Take user input and scrape the url for the selected hostel.
#7. Using scraped data, output name, location, URL, ratings, and top 3 qualities.
#8. Give user option to have the URL opened in their default browser (if possible).
#9. At this point, allow user to start from the beginning.
#10. Should give user option of exiting at any point.

** Possible Additions/Extensions **

1. Take input from user containing dates of stay and # of guests and return availability and pricing.

Availability link below. Appears to follow a somewhat standard sequence regardless of date/guests.
