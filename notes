Scope:

1. Scrape from a hostel website which lists best hostels in various categories.
2. Ask user for input as to what type of hostel they are looking for and then list out the top hostels in that category.
3. Show user additional data (name, location, website, category) for hostel that they select.

Extended:
4. If I am able to "click" to the hostelworld page for the selected hostel, I should return:
  -> the rating
  -> website link
  -> the 3 defining characteristics that appear to be on each page


Scrapers needed:
  -> Scrape main page to collect name, location, url, and category
  -> Scrape secondary page specific to each hostel to collect ratings and defining characteristics

*Important*
  -> Need to scrape main page for basic info and create a new Hostel object with this info.
  -> Each object will be added to an @@all class variable when initialized.
  -> The @@all class variable will be referenced to determine what to return to the user.

**Do I need a Hostel class AND a Category class?
  -> Category has multiple hostels
  -> How do I link the two?
